## Project Description 
      This is an event production and ticketing program that gives a user multiple options to produce an event, attend an event, or list their foodtruck or entertainment services in our database.  The event production option will give a user event locations to choose from as well as vendors they can hire for their event.  The event will be listed in our databse for anyone interested in attending.  If a ticket buyer wants to attend an event they simply need to request a ticket and then choose a meal from the food options available.  They will be assigned a ticket reservation number with their food option.  This app is designed to be the one stop shopping for all event coordinators, entertainers, food service providers, and audience members!
